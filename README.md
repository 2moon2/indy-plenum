##Zeno Byzantine Fault Tolerant Protocol

Zeno makes extensive use of coroutines and the async/await keywords in Python, 
and as such, requires Python version 3.5.0 or later.
 
After cloning the repo, from the root directory of the repo, install it:

```
pip install -e .
```

From here, you can play with the command-line interface:

```
python -m zeno.cli
```

or

```
scripts/cli
```

Or you can run the tests:

```
python -m zeno.test
```
